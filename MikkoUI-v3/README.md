Hi and thank you for installing MikkoUI. 
The installments are extreamly easy and takes all of 2-4 minutes of your time.

Just copy the AddOns folder to > _retail_ > Interface OR to make it even more easier, j8ust copy all the contents in the AddOns folder and put it in your AddOns folder. If a prompt asks you for override permissions, you say yes and replace everything thats there. 9 out of 10 chances are, youll just have a more updated version of an addon. But, most of these addons are not required yet as of this version of UI, however, in the future, it will auto install rather than you copy the Import codes.

Thats all, enjoy the UI.

Any questions or bugs, please visit https://kaos.eldritchvanguard.com/MikkoUI. You can also see most of codes as they are updated often including the imports.
