So with this UI project and idea I came up with, I was also pretty sure that, there were just a small hand full in the community with the same idea and thoughts in mind that, " what if I retain the defaulted UI and just mod it with a much darker feel too it and slightly minimalize it as much as possible since I do Raids & Mythics+ content. I mean, lets face it, who does want a UI that looks like you stepped in grandpa's garage full of things dated back from the 30's and in 2022, he is still collecting and packing them all in 1 place where theres no more room to walk or even... breath fresh or dirty air right?

So, this is where I begin on this project here. [MikkoUI v2](https://github.com).

As you can see in the image above, the details are still there and completely the same as normal with an exceptional bottom bar(bar 1) and its graphics. I have it like this to help me however, using [Bartender4](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bartender4). However it should still all work, look and feel the same should you choose to keep the graphics. Completely up to you :)

The login screen too also has this nice dark feel compared to the normal defaulted version. 

In this repo folder here, you will be able to obtain this UI along with the complete addons with exception to the paid addons such as [Dugi Guides](https://www.dugiguides.com/wow-leveling-guides#headline-style-15)
