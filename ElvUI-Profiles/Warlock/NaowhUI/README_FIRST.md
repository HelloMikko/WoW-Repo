 - ~~Private (Characters Settings)~~
 - ~~Global (Account Settings)~~
 - ~~Aura Filters~~

I may over time add some or not, however you are not with held into creating your own.

### Disclaimer:###
This the main UI was not free, only some of the Profiles will work. Most, you will need the NaowhUI library to work properly within ElvUI. You can get his UI by subbing to his Twitch channel and active within his Discord community. Google for the links.
